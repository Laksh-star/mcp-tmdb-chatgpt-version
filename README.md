## ChatGPT Developer Mode Integration

This server now supports **ChatGPT Developer Mode** with a dedicated MCP implementation:

### Quick Setup for ChatGPT

#### Deployment Steps
1. **Deploy to Railway (or similar platform)**:
   - Set `TMDB_API_KEY` environment variable
   - Deploy using the included `railway.toml` configuration
   - Server will run on `npm run start:chatgpt` command

2. **Add to ChatGPT**:
   - Go to ChatGPT Developer Mode settings
   - Add your deployed server URL
   - ChatGPT will connect to the `/sse` endpoint automatically

3. **Available ChatGPT Tools**:
   - **search**: Search for movies by title or keywords
   - **fetch**: Get detailed movie information by TMDB ID

### Run ChatGPT-compatible server locally:
```bash
npm run start:chatgpt
```

The server will start with SSE endpoints at `/sse` and `/messages` for ChatGPT integration.

### Usage with Claude Desktop

To integrate this server with Claude Desktop, add the following to your app's server configuration file (located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tmdb": {
      "command": "/full/path/to/dist/index.js",
      "env": {
        "TMDB_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/full/path/to` with the actual path to your project directory.

### Installing via Smithery

To install TMDB Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@Laksh-star/mcp-server-tmdb):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @Laksh-star/mcp-server-tmdb --client claude
```

## Example usage

Once the server is running with Claude Desktop, you can use commands like:

1. Search for movies:
   ```
   "Search for movies about artificial intelligence"
   ```

2. Get trending movies:
   ```
   "What are the trending movies today?"
   "Show me this week's trending movies"
   ```

3. Get movie recommendations:
   ```
   "Get movie recommendations based on movie ID 550"
   ```

4. Get movie details:
   ```
   "Tell me about the movie with ID 550"
   ```

### ChatGPT Usage Examples

Once deployed and connected to ChatGPT Developer Mode:

1. **Search movies in ChatGPT**:
   ```
   "Search for sci-fi movies about space"

   ```

2. **Get detailed movie information**:
   ```
   "Fetch details for movie ID 550"

ChatGPT will automatically use the `search` and `fetch` tools to provide movie information directly in the conversation.
